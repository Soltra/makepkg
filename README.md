makepkg remix
=============

Archlinux's makepkg, adapted to create .rpm packages using fpm

* TODO: split package support
* TODO: --clean/--cleanbuild
* TODO: eliminate 'fpmx' call (or decide on a better name ;)
* ...more, but it does most of what I need now.

The original verison is not new, but new enough for me. (v4.2.1)
